## Welcome to Jr Dev! 

This website is a curated collection of insights and tools I wish I had when starting my journey in tech. It's designed to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world experience—the kind of knowledge you gain after college, boot camps, or your first foray into coding.

In my career, I’ve had the privilege of learning from two powerful arenas: Corporate America and contracting. Each taught me invaluable lessons about navigating the professional world of software development. My mission here is to pass on those lessons, insights, and practical skills to help you grow and thrive in your career.

If you’re not a fan of reading blogs, check out our YouTube channel, where I break down the same topics in an easy-to-follow video format.
